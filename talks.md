  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>The fast development and expansion of AI chatbots, such as the most discussed one nowadays, ChatGTP, has already affected the romantic and sexual sphere, and their influence will only rise in the future. This paper broadly explores discrimination in romantic and sexual relationships with AI: whether and how romantic and sexual relationships with chatbots, robots, and other artificial partners can diminish or enhance discrimination.
Since using chatbots, AI has shown racist, sexist, and discriminatory behavior, and there is plenty of research on this topic. They have demonstrated that AI is not racist itself; it only reflects human prejudices and stereotypes that it learns from the data (Wolf etc., 2017; Howard, Borenstein, 2018; Kong, 2022). Thus, there is a way to fix it by giving him inclusive and non-discriminatory data that will not further reinforce societal stereotypes and might even help against discrimination. Applying this to romantic and sexual relationships, does it mean that AI can be an ideal partner that never discriminates? In my talk, I will explore this possibility and argue that AI could be such a perfect partner. I will also discuss how it will change the dating culture and the possible increase of discrimination in love and sex by having such an "artificial" opportunity. With my paper, I hope to bring a technological aspect to the discussion of discrimination in dating and encourage further research on human-robot relationships.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>This chapter explores how Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian women who self-identify as practicing Muslims understand and negotiate gender equality through their search for “true” Islam, which they believe is a right, just, and good religion for women, also morally better than certain cultural practices or a mixture of Islam and culture. It shows that the “true” Islam serves these women as a code of conduct regarding the aspects of life-related to gender equality, such as divorce, virginity, contraception, artificial insemination, abortion, sexual education, violence against women, LGBTQ+ rights, gender, and the female role in the family and the workplace. Female attitudes towards gender equality and understanding of “true” Islam fall into the relative theoretical categories of “traditional,” “pragmatic,” and “post-traditional”, spired by the categories of Inglehart and Welzel (2005). Despite these overarching trends, the research reveals that pious Baltic Muslim women do not fit into clear traditional, pragmatic, or post-traditional patterns; their individual attitudes are diverse, which is reflective of the attitudes of Muslim women living in other non-Muslim societies. However, the chapter also aims to point out the uniqueness of Baltic Muslim women’s narratives, as determined by historical and cultural context.
