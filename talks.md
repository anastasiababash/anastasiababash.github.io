  <p>The fast development and expansion of AI chatbots, such as the most discussed one nowadays, ChatGTP, has already affected the romantic and sexual sphere, and their influence will only rise in the future. This paper broadly explores discrimination in romantic and sexual relationships with AI: whether and how romantic and sexual relationships with chatbots, robots, and other artificial partners can diminish or enhance discrimination.
Since using chatbots, AI has shown racist, sexist, and discriminatory behavior, and there is plenty of research on this topic. They have demonstrated that AI is not racist itself; it only reflects human prejudices and stereotypes that it learns from the data (Wolf etc., 2017; Howard, Borenstein, 2018; Kong, 2022). Thus, there is a way to fix it by giving him inclusive and non-discriminatory data that will not further reinforce societal stereotypes and might even help against discrimination. Applying this to romantic and sexual relationships, does it mean that AI can be an ideal partner that never discriminates? In my talk, I will explore this possibility and argue that AI could be such a perfect partner. I will also discuss how it will change the dating culture and the possible increase of discrimination in love and sex by having such an "artificial" opportunity. With my paper, I hope to bring a technological aspect to the discussion of discrimination in dating and encourage further research on human-robot relationships.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>This chapter explores how Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian women who self-identify as practicing Muslims understand and negotiate gender equality through their search for “true” Islam, which they believe is a right, just, and good religion for women, also morally better than certain cultural practices or a mixture of Islam and culture. It shows that the “true” Islam serves these women as a code of conduct regarding the aspects of life-related to gender equality, such as divorce, virginity, contraception, artificial insemination, abortion, sexual education, violence against women, LGBTQ+ rights, gender, and the female role in the family and the workplace. Female attitudes towards gender equality and understanding of “true” Islam fall into the relative theoretical categories of “traditional,” “pragmatic,” and “post-traditional”, spired by the categories of Inglehart and Welzel (2005). Despite these overarching trends, the research reveals that pious Baltic Muslim women do not fit into clear traditional, pragmatic, or post-traditional patterns; their individual attitudes are diverse, which is reflective of the attitudes of Muslim women living in other non-Muslim societies. However, the chapter also aims to point out the uniqueness of Baltic Muslim women’s narratives, as determined by historical and cultural context.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>The fast development and expansion of digital technologies in every sphere of our everyday life have also affected sex. While in the 90s, the term "cybersex" was used for imagining a bright (or dark) techno future with cyborgs, virtual bodies, and advanced technologies mostly by geeks, nowadays it describes various online sexual activities that a lot of people do (and COVID-19 pandemics has only intensified this by forcing people to move their offline life to the online world including sex). However, despite the fact that
cybersex has become a part of modern everyday life, there is little attention from philosophers on it, and with my presentation (based on my PhD thesis, which I am currently working on), I want to start filling this gap. In my presentation, I will make an overview of becoming more widespread and relevant moral issues surrounding cybersex: online infidelity, cybersex work, cybersexual harassment, cyberrape, etc. I will show how clarifying the definition of cybersex may help in discussing those ethical problems that have been arising with the development of technologies and with more activities going online. Thus, I will argue for the need to build the ethics of cybersex that will consider all those issues, paying attention to the specificity of online relationships.

  <p>The fast development and expansion of digital technologies in every sphere of our everyday life have also affected love and sex. In the 90s, terms like "cyberlove" and "cybersex" were used mostly by geeks to imagine a bright (or dark) techno future with
cyborgs, virtual bodies, and advanced technologies, nowadays it describes various online romantic and sexual activities that a lot of people do (and the COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified this by forcing people to move their offline lives to the online world). This paper tries to explore the concept of equality in cyberrelationships broadly: whether the cyberworld enhances or diminishes intimate equality, or whether there is any specific kind of "online equality" that cannot be achievable in offline relationships, etc.</p><p>At its beginning, the cyberworld seemed like a dream paradise where we could be free from our embodied selves and, thus, from all our prejudices about gender, race, age, origin, etc. The functionality of the World Wide Web rather сultivated equality: once you
entered the forum or chat, you had the same set of rights as others, as well as it became much easier (compared to the offline world) to escape unwanted communication – you close the window on your screen. Clearly, such an egalitarian setting has boosted cyberromance and cybersex and their positive perception: for example, feminists noticed that cyberspace enhances women's sexual autonomy by providing them a safe space to study their own sexuality with less level of shame, less control over their bodies and appearances,
and with greater anonymity. But I believe those findings can be extended to all users in cyberspaces: the safety of cyberspace encourages building more intimate and vulnerable relationships. In my paper, I would like to discuss in more detail in what sense the online world promotes equality in our intimate relationships.</p><p>At the same time, with the wider expansion of digital technologies in our everyday lives, we see how they affect our relationships negatively undermining intimacy. This paper will collect all
possible ways how do this and, thus, challenge the positive perception. Additionally, I will focus on discussing the equal status of our online and offline lovers. Namely, I want to answer the question: should we treat our online partners equally to our offline ones? To do this, I will engage in a long-lasting discussion about online infidelity and whether cheating online is as morally bad as cheating offline. With my paper, I hope to bring a technological aspect to the discussion of intimacy and equality and encourage further research on cyberlove and cybersex.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>In this paper, I would like to research how the current (bad) definitions of internally displaced persons (IDPs)/refugees lead to problems in defining one's own identity and, as a result, (self-)silencing and (self-)neglecting that on its turn lead to the less public and scientific attention and continuing circulating of bad definitions. By doing this, I hope to break this vicious circle and draw attention to this usually under-researched issue that was born from my personal story.</p><p>The starting point for all the discussions on the definition of refugees and IDPs is the definition provided by the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. According to them, the main difference between a refugee and an IDP is whether the person who is forced to move has crossed the international border or not: the one who did is defined as a refugee, and the one who stayed in their own country is an IDP. While most of the public and scientific community's attention is on the problems of refugees and those who have crossed the border, the UNHCR itself admits that IDPs are the most vulnerable group among all those who were forced to leave their homes. They name several reasons for that: a) it is harder to deliver humanitarian assistance to areas where they have moved; b) they have to rely on their own government, even if this government is the reason for their displacement; c) they often are already from the vulnerable groups and cannot cross the border because of the lack of money, health issues, age, gender, obligations over family, etc. In addition to these problems, I want to add that IDPs might even struggle with defining themselves as IDPs or using similar terms. It can happen for different reasons: a) the government does not adopt a special legal status for IDPs and, thus, refuses them help and denies their existence; b) the definition of IDP exists in the legal system of the country, but it has problems not covering all personal cases (e.g., I was studying at the university when my region was occupied, therefore, after getting the degree I cannot be qualified as an IDP, according to the existing laws, because I was not living there at the moment of occupation, but nevertheless I cannot come back home); c) displaced people themselves do not want to adopt this identity because they are afraid of persecution, bullying, or simply of its vulnerable/negative connotations. People who cannot even define themselves as a certain group with a specific experience cannot process it and speak up for themselves. In turn, it leads to our less abilities to help them and even knowing about their existence. I do believe that we should look into the identity crisis that forced displacement brings. Following Arendt's writing
on the refugees (1943), the broken identity, the desire to completely vanish from the old one and forget, and, thus, silencing are the issues that we continue to face today, not only within IDPs but also refugees seeking asylum abroad.</p><p> "Very few individuals have the strength to conserve their own integrity if their social, political and legal status is completely confused. Lacking the courage to fight for a change of our social and legal status, we have decided instead, so many of us, to try a change of identity. [...] Whatever we do, whatever we pretend to be, we reveal nothing but our insane desire to be changed, not to be Jews." (Arendt, 1943).</p><p> Broken identity, shameful denial of it, or desperately seeking a completely new one - all those issues need our attention as researchers and become even more entangled with IDPs, which we usually overlook. How do the people who are forced to leave their houses but remain in their country for different reasons name themselves and/or want to be named? How could we name those like me who did not live in their homes when the crisis arose but are unable to come back home and feel that they lost it? How is the concept of home crucial for our identity and what happens with our own identity when we lose home? I hope to research answers to those questions in my full paper.</p>
