<p>Hi!</p> 

<p>I am a Junior Research Fellow and a PhD candidate in the School of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Tartu, Estonia. I plan to defend my PhD in 2025.</p> 

<p>My PhD thesis is focused on philosophical and religious views on cybersex, as well as the ethics behind it. Broadly, I am interested in how modern technology has changed how we love, have sex, and build relationships. I am also interested in feminism and political philosophy.</p>

<p>Beyond academia, I am dedicated to making philosophy accessible to a wider audience. I run my blog on philosophy and write for <a href="https://getsignal.news">Signal</a>, <a href="https://knife.media/author/anastasiya-babash/">knife.media</a>, <a href="https://beda.media">beda.media</a>, etc. I also teach in academia (University of Tartu) and outside it (<a href="https://www.inliberty.ru">inLiberty Schools</a>). I am always open to cooperation; contact me via email or any social media platform you prefer.</p>

<p>Outside of philosophy, I do yoga, dance tango, and work on the occasional design projects.</p> 

<p>I grew up in Sevastopol (Crimea, Ukraine), and I am proudly Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦</p>
